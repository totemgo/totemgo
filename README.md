**Go!**  
Is a word that defies definition  
It needs no clarification  
**Go!**  
Is the foundation of hardcore  
But for me it means so much more  
**Go!**  
It can signify a chorus or a fast part, too  
A sing along with my friends or a heavy breakdown  
**Let's fucking Go!!!**  
So c'mon man, don't be ashamed  
Screaming "Go!" is not a game  
And for all the bands who don't say it  
You are so fucking lame  
**1-2-3 Go!**  
Next time you are at a show  
And the crucial moment arrives  
Point your finger and shout Go!  
The word Go! is for everyone  
And to say it is so much fun  
But the emo kids hate it  
Next time you are at a show  
And the crucial moment arrives  
Point your finger and shout Go!  
### Spazz - Let's fucking go
